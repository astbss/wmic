Known remaining issues:
 - [upgrade] Conversion from the smbpasswd/TDB passwords to ntPwdHash / lmPwdHash is broken. Couldn't find out why.
 - [ldb_map] Conversion of attribute names in DN's is still a bit dodgy
 - [ldb_map] mapped objectClass names may be mentioned multiple times in returned records
 - [ldb_map] add/modify support not tested very well with LDAP yet (only LDB+TDB)
 - [ldb_map] group membership is not yet mapped (only primaryGroupID / sambaPrimaryGroupSID)
